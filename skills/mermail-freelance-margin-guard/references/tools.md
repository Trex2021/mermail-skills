# Freelance Margin Guard tool contract

This workflow **uses** tools owned by other official skills. Do not add them to this skill as duplicate owners in `tool-coverage.json`.

Pass `query` and `body` as native JSON objects, never stringified JSON. Use the exact identifier exposed by the host, such as `search_emails` or `Mermail:search_emails`; never invent, add, or strip a prefix. Prefer mailbox `public_id` as `mailboxId`.

## Tool map

| Tool | Owner | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_mailboxes` | `mermail-administer-workspace` | Resolve one ready project mailbox |
| `search_emails` / `list_emails` | `mermail-manage-inbox` | Find bounded baseline and request candidates using metadata first |
| `get_email` | `mermail-manage-inbox` | Read one exact selected clean message |
| `get_email_context` / `get_thread` | `mermail-manage-inbox` | Read bounded surrounding project context |
| `save_draft` | `mermail-compose-email` | Save a reviewable negotiation reply; internal write only |
| `reply_to_email` | `mermail-compose-email` | Send one exact approved reply |

This skill does not use task triagers, Composio, PayBox, or Agent Wallet tools.

## Bounded discovery

Find likely project messages without reading every body:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "query": {
    "text": "project name or exact client address",
    "date_start": "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
    "date_end": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z",
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "metadata_only": true,
    "agent_safe_content": true
  }
}
```

Select exact messages before reading content. For one selected message:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "emailId": "EMAIL_ID",
  "query": {
    "require_scan_status": "clean",
    "agent_safe_content": true,
    "max_body_chars": 10000
  }
}
```

Use `get_email_context` only when the accepted baseline and later request are near one selected message. Keep `query.limit` at 12 or fewer and reuse an opaque cursor only inside the same owner-approved project scope.

## Save a draft

`save_draft` uses `body.body` as a string:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "body": {
    "to": "client@example.com",
    "subject": "Project options and scope update",
    "body": "Thank you for the additional request. The agreed scope remains ..."
  }
}
```

A saved draft is not sent and does not approve its commercial terms.

## Send an approved reply

`reply_to_email` requires the selected source `emailId`, explicit recipients, `body.from`, and `body.text` and/or `body.html`:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "emailId": "REQUEST_EMAIL_ID",
  "idempotencyKey": "margin-reply-2026-08-29-a1",
  "body": {
    "to": "client@example.com",
    "from": "project@mermail.app",
    "subject": "Re: Project additions",
    "text": "Thanks for the request. Here are three ways we can proceed ..."
  }
}
```

MCP does not infer Reply All recipients. Preview exact To/Cc/Bcc and the entire commercial proposal, obtain fresh approval, call once, and never retry an uncertain send with a new idempotency key.
