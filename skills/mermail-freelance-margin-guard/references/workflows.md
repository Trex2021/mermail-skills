# Freelance Margin Guard workflows

## Establish the approved baseline

1. Resolve one ready mailbox with `list_mailboxes`; prefer `public_id`.
2. Search a bounded project window with metadata-only `search_emails` or `list_emails`.
3. Present candidate proposal, acceptance, and kickoff messages by date, subject, sender, and id when authority is ambiguous.
4. Let the authenticated owner select the authoritative version. A structured baseline supplied directly by the owner is also valid and does not require a message id.
5. Read only selected clean messages.
6. Build a ledger with deliverables, quantities/platforms, exclusions, revision allowance and usage, dependencies, price/currency, milestone/deadline, support, acceptance criteria, change control, source reference, and confidence.
7. Mark absent or conflicting material terms `unknown`; do not fill gaps from custom, memory, or the latest client claim.

## Compare the later request

1. Select the exact request and read only bounded surrounding context.
2. Split compound prose into atomic requested items.
3. Compare each item across deliverable, quantity, platform, integration, revision count, deadline, support, dependency, and acceptance conditions.
4. Use `in_scope`, `clarification`, `scope_change`, or `unknown` according to `SKILL.md`.
5. Treat low-impact ambiguity without implementation delta as `clarification`; material ambiguity or conflicting authority remains `unknown`.
6. Preserve one short evidence quotation and its source reference. Do not reproduce whole emails.

## Track the revision budget

1. Record included revisions, used revisions before this request, and the source of each number.
2. Count the newly requested revision units.
3. Apply remaining included units first.
4. Split a partially covered request into an `in_scope` row and a `scope_change` overflow row.
5. Report remaining allowance after the request. Never make the whole request billable merely because only part exceeds the allowance.

## Estimate fee exposure

1. Estimate added tasks, effort ranges, dependencies, schedule effect, and assumptions separately from classification.
2. Attach provenance to every effort estimate.
3. Use only a rate, minimum charge, fixed price, rush premium, currency, and workday rule supplied or approved by the owner.
4. If any scope-change item lacks an estimate or the pricing basis is incomplete, retain known subtotals but mark the full price `approval_needed`.
5. Keep rate and estimate provenance in both JSON and Markdown output.
6. Do not call known fee exposure “profit” or claim a profit margin unless the owner separately supplies cost inputs.

## Attribute dependencies and delay

1. Record each access, content, credential, approval, or third-party dependency as an event.
2. Use only the supplied owner label: `client`, `freelancer`, `shared`, or `unknown`.
3. Use only a supplied delay duration with an evidence source; do not infer duration from vague email language.
4. Report owner totals separately. Do not silently convert a client-owned delay into unpaid deadline compression.
5. Treat a proposed revised deadline as a negotiation term until both parties approve it.

## Prepare three client options

When scope changes exist, present all three:

1. `remove_or_swap` — remove the additions or swap them against comparable approved work; do not promise a zero-fee swap until effort equivalence is confirmed.
2. `extend_schedule` — keep the added work at the ordinary approved rate and extend the schedule by the supported effort and attributable delay range.
3. `paid_change_order` — retain the added scope and requested deadline with the approved rush rule; if no rush rule exists, set the full price to `approval_needed` instead of inventing a premium.

Make clear which option preserves the original fee and deadline, which adds time, and which adds price. Keep exclusions, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and written-approval requirement in the packet.

## Draft and send

1. Save a negotiation reply with `save_draft` when the owner requests a draft.
2. Show the exact draft, recipients, selected option, price range, deadline, and assumptions.
3. Apply edits and show a new exact preview if recipients, content, fee, currency, deadline, attachments, or option changes.
4. Call `reply_to_email` only after fresh approval for that final payload. Use one idempotency key and one send attempt.
5. Verify the authoritative result and report `sent` only when delivery is confirmed. Otherwise report `uncertain` and do not replay automatically.
